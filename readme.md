# Bar Charts using d3.js

At work was recently asked to create a bar chart similar to this ![](https://i.imgur.com/E4FhRYq.png)

Well I never came across bar charts having progress bar's in school/college :confused:

But with d3.js impossible is nothing. So I decided to learn how to create a basic bar chart and take it from there.

I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBt-7PuaLk) video tutorial by [Curran Kelleher](https://twitter.com/currankelleher) which explains about bar chart creation and required apis in d3 quite well.
