# Bar Charts using d3.js

At work was recently asked to create a bar chart similar to this ![](https://i.imgur.com/E4FhRYq.png)

Well I never came across bar charts having progress bar's in school/college :confused:

But with d3.js impossible is nothing. So I decided to learn how to create a basic bar chart and take it from there.

I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBt-7PuaLk) video tutorial by [Curran Kelleher](https://twitter.com/currankelleher) which explains about bar chart creation and required apis in d3 quite well.

# How to run this project
To get started :
* We need a local dev server to host our files, this can be done easily by installing this lovely npm package [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
* Then in the terminal run `http-server` to run the server.
* I use visual studio code to develop this project, and [Debugger For Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) extension for better js debugging.
